# Mental-Health-NHANES-Study
Mental Health Analysis Using NHANES Data
Project Overview
This project explores mental health as influenced by a variety of socioeconomic, demographic, lifestyle, and health factors using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The primary objective is to investigate associations between mental health and specific demographic groups and factors, as well as determine which factors contribute most significantly to mental health issues.

Project Structure
Final_Project.R: R script for data analysis, including descriptive statistics and generalized linear model (GLM) analysis to explore the relationships between different variables and mental health.
Final_Project_VC.pdf: Documentation providing an in-depth explanation of the project, hypotheses, data extraction process, and analytical approach, as well as results and discussion.
Research Objectives
Primary Aim: Identify the gender and age group most affected by mental health challenges.
Secondary Aim: Determine which of the four categories—Lifestyle, Socioeconomic, Demographic, or Health—has the strongest association with mental health.
Hypotheses
Primary Hypothesis:
Null (H0): No significant association exists between age, gender, and mental health outcomes.
Alternative (Ha): A significant association exists between age, gender, and mental health outcomes.
Secondary Hypothesis:
Null (H0): No significant association exists between the four factor categories (Lifestyle, Socioeconomic, Demographic, Health) and mental health outcomes.
Alternative (Ha): A significant association exists between these factor categories and mental health outcomes.
Methodology
Data Extraction: Extracted data from NHANES with a focus on variables relevant to mental health across four categories: Lifestyle, Socioeconomic, Demographic, and Health.
Statistical Analysis: GLM analysis was conducted to assess associations, with a focus on identifying significant predictors and comparing categories based on AIC and BIC values.
Results Summary
Primary Findings: Adults, especially young adults and females, report more mental health challenges.
Secondary Findings: Health and lifestyle factors have the most substantial impact on mental health, followed by socioeconomic and demographic factors.
